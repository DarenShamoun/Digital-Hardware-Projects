
COMP 300 - Project 2 (7-Segment Display)

1. Your FULL Name: Daren Shamoun
   Your USD Email Address: darenshamoun@sandiego.edu

2. A typed copy of USD's academic integrity pledge, followed by your typed
   initials (as a way of "signing the pledge.").

   The academic integrity pledge can be found on page 3 of
   the document found here: https://www.sandiego.edu/conduct/documents/HonorCode.pdf
   To be clear, it is the text that starts, "I pledge to demonstrate...".

   I pledge to demonstrate personal and academic integrity in all matters with my fellow students, 
   the faculty, and the administration here at USD. I promise to be honest and accountable for my actions; 
   and to uphold the statutes of scholastic honesty to better myself and those around me.

3. Briefly describe your design methodology, including how you determined the final
   Boolean equations for your design and how you went about designing the circuit
   to implement that equation.

   I used K maps to determine the initial boolean equation and then I simplified the equations as much as possible, 
   using distributive property on the highest D values together if possible, 
   and then repeating the distributive again until it was as simple as possible, sometimes using DeMorgans to simplify this as well.
   For designing the circut I was following the best practices you showed us in class and had the input and their corresponding not values
   at the top going down vertically and then having each different output equation ordered from S[6] to S[0] and starting at the most
   innermost parenthesis designing those circuts and then building up from there.

4. Output Equations:

	Sa = D3'(D2D0 + D1) + D2'(D1'(D3 + D0')) + D1(D2 + D0')
   Sb = D3'(D1D0 + D1'D0' + D2') + D2'(D1D0' + D1') + D3D1'D0
	Sc = D3'(D2 + D1' + D0) + D1'D0 + D3D2'
	Sd = D2(D1'(D3 + D0) + D1D0') + D2'(D1(D3' + D0) + D1'D0')
	Se = D0'(D2'D1'+D1) + D3(D2 + D1)
	Sf = D3(D1 + D2') + D2(D1D0' + D3'D1') + D2'D1'D0'
	Sg = D1(D2' + D0') + D2D1' + D3
   
5. The estimated number of hours spent working on the project: 12


6. Did you submit on time? (If not, you will be charged one comp300 buck.)
   yes


7. (Optional) Any feedback you with to give me relating the project (e.g. Was it
   interesting? How could it be improved?)
