3. A typed copy of USD's academic integrity pledge, followed by BOTH you and your
   partner's typed initials (as a way of "signing the pledge.").

   The academic integrity pledge can be found on page 3 of
   the document found here: https://www.sandiego.edu/conduct/documents/HonorCode.pdf
   To be clear, it is the text that starts, "I pledge to demonstrate...".

“I pledge to demonstrate personal and academic integrity in all matters with my fellow
students, the faculty, and the administration here at USD. I promise to be honest and
accountable for my actions; and to uphold the statutes of scholastic honesty to better
myself and those around me.”
