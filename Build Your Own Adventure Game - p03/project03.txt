COMP 300 @ USD
Project 3: Adventure Game

1. Partner A's FULL Name: Daren Shamoun
   Partner A's USD Email Address: darenshamoun@sandiego.edu

   Partner B's FULL Name: Tony Abelson
   Partner B's USD Email Address: tabelson@sandiego.edu

2. A typed copy of USD's academic integrity pledge, followed by BOTH you and your
   partner's typed initials (as a way of "signing the pledge.").

   The academic integrity pledge can be found on page 3 of
   the document found here: https://www.sandiego.edu/conduct/documents/HonorCode.pdf
   To be clear, it is the text that starts, "I pledge to demonstrate...".

   I pledge to demonstrate personal and academic integrity in all matters with my fellow students, 
   the faculty, and the administration here at USD. I promise to be honest and accountable for my actions; 
   and to uphold the statutes of scholastic honesty to better myself and those around me.

   DS, TA

3. Briefly describe your design methodology, including how you determined the final
   Boolean equations for your design and how you went about designing the circuit
   to implement that equation.

   We dervied the boolean equations by creating the finite state machine diagram, 
   then we filled out the input and output tables for our two FSMs. From those
   tables we derived our boolean equations and simplified and tested the equations.
   Then when we designed the circuts we followed the PLA guidelines and 
   the circut fell together nicely after that. 

4. Next State Equations: (From your final state transition table.)

	S0_next = R + S1W
   S1_next = R'(S0E + S2N)
	S2_next = R'(S1S + S3E)
	S3_next = R'S2W
	S4_next = R'S2E
	S5_next = R'V'S4
	S6_next = R'VS4

5. Output Equations: (From your output tables.)

	sw = S3
	d = S5
	win = S6
	v = S1
   
5. The estimated number of hours spent working on the project:

	Partner A working alone: 1 hours
	Partner B working alone: 1 hours
	Working together: 6 hours


6. Did you submit on time? (If not, you will be charged one comp300 buck.)

yes


7. (Optional) Any feedback you with to give me relating the project (e.g. Was it
   interesting? How could it be improved?)

   The testing p03_die_tb.sv file has the input named reset, but in the instructions 
   you asked for it to be named r in the waveform diagram, for ours we kept it as reset.
